EXPERIMENT 1 : Basic programming experiments – Control Flow, Loop, Functions, Vectors

Develop an R program to 
    1. Create an empty vector and append values. 
    2. Create three vectors numeric data, character data, and logical data. Display the content of the vectors and their type. 
    3. Create three vectors a, b, and c with 3 integers. Combine the three vectors to become a 3×3 matrix where each column represents a vector. Print the content of the matrix. 
    4. Find the maximum and the minimum value of a given vector. 
    5. Get the first 10 Fibonacci numbers 
    6. Get all prime numbers up to a given number using functions. 
    7. Find the factors of a given number using functions. 
    8. Compute the sum, mean, and product of given vector elements. 
    9. Add and Subtract Days to and from Date. 
    10. Calculate the number of days between two dates.
