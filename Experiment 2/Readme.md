EXPERIMENT 2 : Array, Matrices

Develop an R program to 
    1. Create an array called threed with three dimensions with 3 elements in the first, 2 in the second, and 2 in the third. Name your first dimension as "Stock Price", "Revenue", "Employees", the second as "2018","2019" and the third as "Apple",  "Microsoft". Feed the array with the following data: (155, 261, 132000,423.4, 321, 137000,105, 240, 118000,157.64, 260, 139000) 
    2. Using array indexes, compute the difference between Apple's stock price in 2019 and 2018. Store it in an object called diff_price. Based on the diff_price object, compute the percentage difference (in decimal format, where for instance: 0.5 equals to 50%) between Apple's stock price in 2019 and 2018. Use array indexes again to find the 2018 Apple stock price in the three arrays. 
    3. Create a two-dimensional 5×3 array of a sequence of even integers greater than 50. 
    4. Create 5 × 4 matrices, 3 × 3 matrices with labels and fill the matrix by rows, and 2 × 2 matrices with labels and fill the matrix with columns. 
    5. Transpose the matrix and save it in an object. 
    6. Use matrix multiplication properties to compute the multiplication of 2 matrices and save it in an object called matrix_mul. Hint: Remember the %*% operator.
